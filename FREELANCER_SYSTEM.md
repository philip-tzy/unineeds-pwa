# Freelancer System Implementation

This document explains the freelancer system implementation which allows freelancers to manage their own data without relying on dummy data.

## Overview

The freelancer system includes the following functionality:

1. **Skills Management**: Freelancers can add, edit, and delete their professional skills
2. **Services Management**: Freelancers can offer services with pricing, delivery times, and portfolio examples
3. **CRUD Operations**: Complete Create, Read, Update, Delete functionality for freelancer data
4. **Security**: Row-level security policies ensure freelancers can only manage their own data

## Database Schema

The main tables related to freelancers are:

- `services`: Services offered by freelancers
- `skills`: Individual freelancer skills
- `freelancer_skills`: Detailed skills with categories and rates
- `freelance_jobs`: Jobs posted that freelancers can apply for
- `job_applications`: Applications for jobs by freelancers

## Cleaning Up Dummy Data

To remove all dummy freelancer data and ensure freelancers can manage their own data:

1. A migration file has been created at `migrations/20240610_cleanup_freelancer/migration.sql`
2. This SQL script:
   - Removes all dummy data from freelancer-related tables
   - Verifies and recreates row-level security policies
   - Adds performance optimizations (indexes)

You can apply this migration in several ways:

### Using the Migration System
```bash
# Run this to apply all pending migrations
npx supabase db push
```

### Using the Cleanup Script
```bash
# Set environment variables first
export SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
export SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your-supabase-service-key

# Run the script
node clean_freelancer_data.js
```

### Manual Execution
If necessary, you can manually execute the SQL in the migration file using any SQL client connected to your Supabase PostgreSQL database.

## Components

The freelancer system includes the following React components:

1. **SkillsList**: Displays freelancer skills with options to edit/delete
2. **SkillForm**: Form for adding/editing skills
3. **SkillRow**: Individual skill row component
4. **ServicesList**: Displays freelancer services with options to edit/delete
5. **SimpleServiceForm**: Form for adding/editing services 
6. **ServiceRow**: Individual service row component
7. **FreelancerBottomNavigation**: Navigation component for freelancers

## API Services

The API services for freelancers include:

1. **Skill Management**:
   - `getSkills`
   - `addSkill`
   - `updateSkill`
   - `deleteSkill`

2. **Service Management**:
   - `getFreelancerServices`
   - `addFreelancerService`
   - `updateFreelancerService`
   - `deleteFreelancerService`

3. **Job Management**:
   - `getAvailableJobs`
   - `applyForJob`
   - `updateJobStatus`
   - `getFreelancerJobs`

## Security

Security is implemented using Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) policies:

1. Each table has policies ensuring freelancers can only:
   - Read their own data
   - Create data connected to their user ID
   - Update their own data
   - Delete their own data

2. All security policies are enforced at the database level for maximum security

## File Upload

Freelancers can upload portfolio files with the following features:

1. Files are stored in the `service_portfolios` storage bucket
2. Each freelancer has their own folder based on their user ID
3. RLS policies ensure freelancers can only upload to/modify their own folders
4. Public read access is granted for all portfolio files

## Implementation Notes

1. All forms include validation to ensure data quality
2. Error handling is implemented at both frontend and backend levels
3. The API includes extensive logging for troubleshooting
4. Database changes maintain backward compatibility
